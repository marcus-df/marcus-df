<h2 align="center">marcus-df's GitHub profile</h2>

 ### 🥁 In these old boxes you will find... ✨😲
 - [X] dusty and buggy projects from before I started working web-dev. 🕸️🪲
 - [X] empty skeleton projects that never actually became anything. 🦴
 - [ ] interesting code that can be repurposed for something productive. 💩

> [!NOTE]\
> When I get some time and inspiration (really if), I'm planning on renovating this profile, add and develop some of my ideas for projects.
